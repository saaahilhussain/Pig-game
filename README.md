# Pig-game
Pig is a classic two-player dice game of strategy and luck. Players take turns rolling the dice, aiming to reach the target score without rolling a 1. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project is a great way to practice basic web development skills while creating a fun and interactive game.
